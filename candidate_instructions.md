# Data Engineer/Scientist Test

Thanks a lot for applying to our Data Engineering position at GensDeConfiance!
We're super excited to learn more about your profile and background.

To help us understand how you work, we have put together this test. It involves
working with some sample data that could be coming from our website. The data
you'll be playing with is randomly generated - it does not come from our
production database.

The test goes along two dimensions:

1. Data engineering: the test involves cleaning up the data and making it
   available for querying.
2. Data science: you will then be asked to gather some analysis from the data.

This is a relatively recent test, so we don't know for sure how long it should
take you to finish it. That being said, out of respect for your time, please
try not to spend more than three hours on it. You are free to spend more time
if you want, but in that case, please let us know about it. If there are things you
would have done if you had had more time, please include them in your
`README.md`.

# Instructions

1. Download the `.csv` attached.
2. Write a production-ready script that imports the `.csv` data into a SQL
   database. You are free to choose whichever SQL database technology you want,
   but please justify it. Please also include instructions about how to deploy
   it locally (e.g., with Docker). Assume that the users are on a Mac
   Os or Linux environment.
3. Write a report for our business executives. The report should layout
   business and product ideas that you can infer from the dataset. Include at
   least one chart.
4. Include a `README` that details your process and the technical decisions you
   made along the way.
5. Send us your work, preferably under the form of a shared git repository.

As for the technologies, you can pick whatever language is best suited for the
task, although we would appreciate it if you chose a commonly used data science
language such as Python for both the script and the analysis. This is also the
language we use inside our data team.

## How we review

### Data engineering

The data import script is simple, but please write it as if it was going to be
heavily used and improved. If you have time, show us how well you can
structure it for maintainability and extensibility.

* Production-readiness (and how you define it)
* Consistent code style
* Code quality
* Correctness
* Documentation (installation instructions, what remains to do) and its
  readability (conciseness, absence of typos)
* Testing
* Code architecture
* API

### Analysis

* Is the analysis non-obvious and useful?
* Is the analysis clear and well-communicated?
* Are there some product and business ideas included?
* Readability: quality of the included graph(s), conciseness, layout,
  typography
